# Environment

Run `tsc --watch` when developing so that typescript builds the `built/main.js` file when changes are made to the `src/main.ts` file.

# Debug Mode

The debug mode bypasses the call to metabase to download a store's order data. You must ensure the server already has the data when using debug mode.
